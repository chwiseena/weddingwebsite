        <WeddingPartyMOH name="Eimi Satoh" description="Eimi and Christina met as 8th graders in the hallowed halls of Harrington Park School. To Christina, Eimi was the new kid from Japan who she had befriended. To Eimi, Christina's friendliness was plain confusing. But when Christina gave Eimi a most American homecoming by introducing her to the marvels of Rice-A-Roni, Eimi knew Christina was the real deal." descriptionTwo=" The complementarity of Christina's kindness and Eimi's frankness has sustained their friendship over the years. Eimi will tell you without hesitation that 'that color is not your color,' but she'll also be the first to celebrate when you find one that works. It's landed her in hot water at times, but that's exactly why she'll be working to keep all the important bits and pieces running smoothly as maid of honor. She will be taking occasional breaks from her duties to break it down on the dance floor." filename="Eimi.jpeg"/>

After noticing Chris's replica portal gun, Aster knew she was a total nerd. Little did she know that they would live together the next year in the Music Appreciation House and grow to be lifelong friends, watching anime and viewing sunrises from the wrong cardinal direction. Thomas was a fellow fris-bro who Aster got to know better through driving him to tournaments and playing webb, moose, and nannerball. Whether playing table top RPGs or shotgunning in shark showers with the two, Aster is very happy to see her good friends get married, and hopes for the best in all their future endeavors (that don't involve Mario Party)." filename="aster.jpg"/>

        <WeddingPartyMemberAlt name="Andrew Hutcheson" description="Hutch first met Christina through being in the same incoming group of freshmen for band camp. While not interacting much during band camp, we both were wearing matching plaid shirts at our first midnight kickball and our friendship was set in stone. Little did Hutch or Puddles know at the time, the two were in the same freshman orientation group at college. Puddles would become a minor plot point in Hutch's junior year when Puddles decided to actively participate in pep band for basketball. The minor subplot eventually expanded into the major storyline that was the year all three got together regularly to watch anime when Hutch lived near them in Massachusetts." filename="hutch.jpg"/>

Where Chris is open and friendly, Cassie is more reserved and quiet, so it took some time to really get to know each other. However, after many discussions of work gossip, sharing each other's weeby interests, and getting forced to attend a party at a mostly empty apartment, the friendship was set and there was no going back." filename="cassie.jpg"/>

Their friendship bloomed after meeting the two during their junior year at Lehigh University. From nights out on the town, travelling the world, high-fantasy RPG games, or even just hanging around one of their living rooms, one would be hard-pressed to find a way not to enjoy the company of the three. Doug cannot wait to see what the future brings for the newly-weds-to-be and look forward to celebrating their relationship taking the next step!" filename="doug.jpeg"/>

Though 3 years her senior (but who's counting?), the two became fast friends and quickly bonded over being general goofballs and going to concerts (with the typical threats to his wellbeing from the father of the bride-to-be). He met Tom a few years later on a trip to Lehigh and soon saw the love the lucky couple still shares to this day.
