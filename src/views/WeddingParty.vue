        <WeddingPartyMOH name="Eimi Satoh" description="Eimi and Christina met as 8th graders in the hallowed halls of Harrington Park School. To Christina, Eimi was the new kid from Japan who she had befriended. To Eimi, Christina's friendliness was plain confusing. But when Christina gave Eimi a most American homecoming by introducing her to the marvels of Rice-A-Roni, Eimi knew Christina was the real deal." descriptionTwo=" The complementarity of Christina's kindness and Eimi's frankness has sustained their friendship over the years. Eimi will tell you without hesitation that 'that color is not your color,' but she'll also be the first to celebrate when you find one that works. It's landed her in hot water at times, but that's exactly why she'll be working to keep all the important bits and pieces running smoothly as maid of honor. She will be taking occasional breaks from her duties to break it down on the dance floor." filename="Eimi.jpeg"/>

        <WeddingPartyBM name="Nicholas Ferris" description="Nicholas is Thomas's younger brother. Growing up, and possibly to this day, Nicholas has been the biggest nuisance to Thomas. He still gets a kick out of pushing one too many of Thomas's buttons, but with that being said, Nicholas appreciates everything about Thomas. Growing up, Thomas was an amazing role model and someone Nicholas still looks up to today. Thomas has gifted Nicholas with some of his most cherished memories. From making silly faces at Thomas from across a restaurant table in their younger days to spending way too many hours in a row playing video games until they were both purple with laughter, Nicholas can not think of time that Thomas has not brightened his day." descriptionTwo="Beyond all of the smiles that Thomas has brought to Nicholas's face, his impact goes much deeper. Thomas has been an unfaltering pillar of support for Nicholas no matter what the situation has been. Thomas is someone that Nicholas repeatedly counts on to be there for him and Thomas is without fail. Nicholas is eternally grateful for all Thomas has done for him and hopes he can pay a fraction of it back by being the best best man for his brother who he loves. Nicholas looks forward to Christina joining the family, which at this point is fairly redundant. He believes that Christina brings out the best in his brother and it makes Nicholas extremely happy to see how happy she makes Thomas. Nicholas loves them both very much and can't wait to embarrass himself on the dance floor of their wedding. For anyone who knows Nicholas, you know he hates dancing, but if this is not a special enough occasion he do not know what is." filename="nicholas.jpg"/>

        <WeddingPartyMember name="Aster Schmidt" description="Aster first met Christina as her girlfriend's hallmate's roommate. After noticing Chris's replica portal gun, Aster knew she was a total nerd. Little did she know that they would live together the next year in the Music Appreciation House and grow to be lifelong friends, watching anime and viewing sunrises from the wrong cardinal direction. Thomas was a fellow fris-bro who Aster got to know better through driving him to tournaments and playing webb, moose, and nannerball. When Aster saw her two friends junior year trying to one-up one another in Super Mario Sunshine, she knew they were meant to be, and were ecstatic when two of her favorite people started dating. Whether playing table top RPGs or shotgunning in shark showers with the two, Aster is very happy to see her good friends get married, and hopes for the best in all their future endeavors (that don't involve Mario Party)." filename="aster.jpg"/>

        <WeddingPartyMemberAlt name="Andrew Hutcheson" description="Hutch first met Christina through being in the same incoming group of freshmen for band camp. While not interacting much during band camp, the two both were wearing matching plaid shirts at their first midnight kickball and their friendship was set in stone. Little did Hutch or Tom know at the time, the two were in the same freshman orientation group at college. Tom would become a minor plot point in Hutch's junior year when he decided to actively participate in pep band for basketball. The minor subplot eventually expanded into the major storyline that was the year all three got together regularly to watch anime when Hutch lived near them in Massachusetts." filename="hutch.jpg"/>

Where Chris is open and friendly, Cassie is more reserved and quiet, so it took some time to really get to know each other. However, after many discussions of work gossip, sharing each other's weeby interests, and getting forced to attend a party at a mostly empty apartment, the friendship was set and there was no going back." filename="cassie.jpg"/>

Their friendship bloomed after meeting the two during their junior year at Lehigh University. From nights out on the town, travelling the world, high-fantasy RPG games, or even just hanging around one of their living rooms, one would be hard-pressed to find a way not to enjoy the company of the three. Doug cannot wait to see what the future brings for the newly-weds-to-be and look forward to celebrating their relationship taking the next step!" filename="doug.jpeg"/>

Though 3 years her senior (but who's counting?), the two became fast friends and quickly bonded over being general goofballs and going to concerts (with the typical threats to his wellbeing from the father of the bride-to-be). He met Tom a few years later on a trip to Lehigh and soon saw the love the lucky couple still shares to this day.

Jenn and Christina’s paths didn’t cross much until Jenn sat with Christina in Calc 1 their junior year and said, ‘Hey!! You’re that Crazy Russian Chick!!’ Little did Jenn know that she was not Russian, but she was crazy (in all the best possible ways), and little did Jenn know that would be the start of an amazing friendship. As the typical poor college kid, Jenn did not want to pay to do laundry in her apartment so Christina graciously allowed Jenn to do it at her house while they studied for calculus. Christina helped Jenn pass the class, and Jenn helped Christina pass biology core III in turn. Over the years, these two grew close as Christina became part of the 457 family, a seamless transition that also involved Thomas. Christina and Jenn became important parts of each other’s lives, helping one another through the many curve balls the game of life has thrown their way. What began as friendly gestures grew into a wonderful friendship that will last a lifetime. Game on." filename="jenn.png"/>
